## Key Challenges
This was my first big project involving CSS, CSS has been a struggle for me so the hardest part of this project was making the front end page.
I have learnt a lot from this project which i will be able to transfer into other projects.

## Development 
- JS 
- HTML
- CSS

I started by drawing up a mockup on paper from them i made it with HTML, i then went about the logic for the game.
I first made all the boxes contain a value and then that value is added to a player array, after that i made it so a box that is alreay clicked on, it wouldnt do anything in the script.
After all of this i went about the winning logic, i started by getting all the possible wins and puting each one into an array. Once this was done i needed to figure out how to cycle through the player array and check if they have played any of these sequences. After all this was completed i spent a lot of time on the style as it is not my strong suit. after i had it looking nice i started to add in some extra features.
## Things To Add
- More CSS style
- Sounds
- Switch player feature
- Resize the app
